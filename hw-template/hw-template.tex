\textbf{Instruction}
\begin{itemize}
\item To compile a \LaTeX file, you can use either the \texttt{pdflatex} command on your local machine or online tools like
  \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes}{Overleaf}.
  If you're new to \LaTeX make some effort to learn how to use it properly especially regarding math environments like \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Aligning_equations_with_amsmath}{align}.
\item Create a new blank file (e.g., \texttt{hw1.tex}). Copy \ul{\textbf{hw-template.tex}} into it. Don't change on this file directly, as you might want to reuse it.
\item Delete this instruction part.
\item Change the author info: name, email, netid.
\item Change the homework info: name, due date, and students you worked with for this homework.
\item For the coding part, you need to write your own code.
\item When you finish your homework, download the pdf, and rename it before submitting to Canvas: \texttt{firstname-lastname-sol1.pdf}.
\item The supplemented \ul{\textbf{header.tex}} includes some useful packages and commands that make it easy to write things
  like $\expected{x \sim p}{-\log p(x)}$. Feel free to modify and define your own commands.
